# LibraryTracker System (Java)

## Project Overview
This is a **basic Library Management System** built using Java.  
It is a console-based application that helps manage library operations like adding books, issuing books, returning books, and managing users.

The project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction.

---

## Features
- Add new books to the library
- Add new users
- Show all books in the library
- Issue a book to a user
- Return a book
- Menu-driven console interface

---

## Project Structure

LibraryManagement/
│
├── Book.java # Represents a book entity
├── User.java # Represents a user entity
├── Library.java # Contains core library management operations
└── Main.java # Entry point with menu-driven interface


---

## Key Concepts Used
- **Java Classes & Objects** – Book, User, Library, Main  
- **Encapsulation** – Private fields with getters/setters  
- **Abstraction** – Hiding internal logic like issue/return methods  
- **ArrayList** – To store books and users dynamically  
- **Scanner** – For user input  
- **Switch-case and loops** – Menu navigation  
- **toString()** – Displaying object details  

---

## How to Run
1. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/LibraryManagement
Compile all Java files:

javac *.java


Run the project:

java Main


Use the menu to interact with the library system.




Future Enhancements

Search books by title or author

Delete books or users

Track due dates and calculate fines

Connect with a database (MySQL/SQLite) for persistent storage

Add GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
